# code-refactor-homework-wk-1

## Description

This project is my first homework of the Coding Bootcamp course and in which I take an already made website called "Horiseon", and make a few adjustments and fixes. As I added my own code into this project, I changed the div tags into html semantic elements, such as footer, section, article, and header. If you look through the html file, you will see that I left comments before every adjustment, including the change I made to the title. I wanted the let it be known what it was exactly I had changed for myself and for everyone that sees my edits. I also condensed the css file to be more organized and attractive, but putting identically styled classes together.

As this is my first project of the course, doing this homework helps me to understand html and css a little more, along with ways to make my coding more aesthetically pleasing and organized. While I revised the code, I learned how to bring together more than one class in the css file if they have the same styling. I also learned about html semantic elements, which I didn't know about before starting this project.
